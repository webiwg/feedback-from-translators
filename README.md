# Feedback from Translators  
This project gathers feedback from translators for those who write technical documentation.

## I want to help but I don't know how to use Github
Don't worry. We **want** to help people like you. If you are new to contribute to this project or want somebody to do so, 
you can write an email to vdaneto@inf.ufrgs.br and emerson@alligo.com.br and still provide us feedback. We can also help you to use Github step-by-step.
